The Magic Lamp (vbscript)

One day a programmer was feeling a bit down in the dumps!

Gee Whiz -  I can't seem to get anyting right, no matter what I do or say.

Nothing seems to be working out for me, what's the use of being motiviated to 
do anything ??.. EVER!! UGGG !!!

So one day (s)he started nosing around in varoius folders in the company directory and
happened to come across this strange zip file called "magiclamp".

Still feeling down but now a little curious, our semi-adventurous programmer 
decided, what the heck, I'll open it and see what is inside!

So (s)he decided to extract the contents to his hard drive and came across 
this very README file that you are reading at this very moment !!

After carefully examing the contents and the code and declaring them safe our
programmer decided to go ahead and very carefully RIGHT CLICKED ON the 
INSTALL.BAT file and choose "RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"

..and from that moment forward his (or her?) life changed forever.

Or at least...so far as anyone really knows...


...THE END... ?
